A TCP port is a logical communication endpoint used by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to identify specific services or applications running on a device.

Think of it like this:

IP address = the building’s street address

Port number = the specific apartment inside the building

When data is sent over the internet:

The IP address identifies the device.

The port number identifies the specific application or service on that device.

🔢 Port Number Range

TCP ports range from 0 to 65535 and are divided into:

Well-known ports (0–1023) – Reserved for common services

80 → HTTP

443 → HTTPS

22 → SSH

21 → FTP

25 → SMTP

Registered ports (1024–49151) – Used by software applications

Dynamic/Private ports (49152–65535) – Temporary ports used by clients

🔄 How TCP Ports Work

When you open a website:

Your browser uses a temporary (ephemeral) port.

It connects to the server’s IP on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).

TCP ensures reliable delivery (ordered, error-checked).
